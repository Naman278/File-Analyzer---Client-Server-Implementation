The project is a client-server implementation of a file analyzer, which allows the client to send the name of a file to the server and receive various statistics about the file in return.
The client-side of the application is written in Python and uses the socket library to establish a connection to the server.
Once a connection is established, the client prompts the user to enter the name of a file that they wish to analyze.
The client sends the file name to the server, which receives the file name using the recv() method of the socket object.
The server then opens the file and counts the number of words, characters, and lines in the file using a function named "counter".
The counter function uses the built-in open function in Python to open the file in read-only mode and then iterates through the file line by line, counting the number of words, characters, and lines in the file.
Once the server has calculated the statistics for the file, it sends the results back to the client as a single integer value.
The client receives the integer value and then unpacks it into its component parts (i.e., the number of words, characters, and lines).
The client then displays the statistics to the user on the command line.
The user can enter the word "over" to terminate the client application and close the connection to the server.
The server is designed to handle multiple client connections simultaneously using Python's threading module.
